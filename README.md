# CSC-365-A3
"Write a program that collects at least 500 Wikipedia pages and links from these pages to other Wikipedia pages. Collect word frequencies as in Assignments 1 and 2 (but feel free to limit to a fixed number of most frequent words). As a connectivity check, report the number of spanning trees (for any arbitrary node as initial starting point). Store persistently (possibly just in a Serialized file). Write a program (either GUI or web-based) that reads the graph from step 1, allows a user to select any two pages (by title) and displays graphically the shortest (weighted by any similarity metric) path between them, if one exists."
